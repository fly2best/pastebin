random sampling

stratified sampling
the population is split into similar groups that share similar characteristics.
These charateristics or groups are called strata, and each individual group is called a stratum.

cluster sampling
cluster sampling is useful if the population has a number of similar
groups or clusters. As an example, gumballs might be sold in packets,
with each packet containing a similar number of gumballs with similar
colors. Each packet would form a cluster.

systematic sampling
choose a number k, and sample every kth unit.
