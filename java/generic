thinking in java的15.8节的末尾提到:

In his weblog, 3 Neal Gafter (one of the lead developers for Java SE5) points out that he was
lazy when rewriting the Java libraries, and that we should not do what he did. Neal also
points out that he could not fix some of the Java library code without breaking the existing
interface. So even if certain idioms appear in the Java library sources, that’s not necessarily
the right way to do it. When you look at library code, you cannot assume that it’s an example
that you should follow in your own code.

library中的代码不一定是最正确的做法. 还是要多问为什么哈?
